The Git repository contains a React application that demonstrates the implementation of a tabbed interface with different functionalities for each tab. The application uses React's useState hook for managing state and allows users to interact with each tab to show/hide details, increment likes, and perform undo actions.
The main component of the application is App, which renders the Tabbed component. The Tabbed component handles the tab selection and displays the corresponding tab content based on the active tab. It also provides an option to display a different tab content when the user selects a tab with an index greater than 2.

Each tab is represented by the Tab component, which receives the tab number, the active tab index, and a click handler as props. When a tab is clicked, the click handler updates the active tab index, and the corresponding tab content is displayed.

The content of each tab is defined in the content array and includes a summary and details. The tab content is displayed using the TabContent component, which renders the summary and details. Users can show/hide the details by clicking the "Show details" button. The component also includes a like counter, and users can increment the likes using the "+" and "+++" buttons.

The handleUndo function allows users to undo changes made to the tab state. Additionally, there is a handleUndoLater function that demonstrates using setTimeout to trigger the undo action after a delay of 2 seconds.

The DifferentContent component is used to display a special message when the user selects a tab with an index greater than 2. It resets the state, emphasizing that it is a different tab.

Overall, the application showcases how to build a tabbed interface in React and how to manage different functionalities and state for each tab. The code can serve as a reference for developers looking to implement similar tabbed interfaces with interactive functionalities in their React projects.
